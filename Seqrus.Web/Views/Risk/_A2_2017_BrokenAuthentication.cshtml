<div class="seq-description">
    <p>
        To be confident in the identity of your individual users, you need to look at how authentication is implemented.
        What are the ways in which a user can authenticate? When and how can credentials be revoked? When and how can they be recovered?
        How are passwords generated, communicated and stored?
    </p>
    <p>Exposure to this risk means that an attacker can impersonate a legitimate user and thereby gain access to your data.</p>

        <p>
            Attackers have to gain access to only a few accounts, or just one admin account to compromise the system.
            Depending on the domain of the application, this may allow money laundering, social security fraud,
            and identity theft, or disclose legally protected highly sensitive information.

                    Attempt to authenticate to the application using a known account name, but invalid password.

            <ul>
                <li>If <risk-exposure is-exposed="true" />, each attempt will be evaluated (and responded to in a timely manner), indicating that a brute-force attack might be possible. Note though that adequate password complexity requirements can make the estimated time required for brute forcing infeasibly high. If the authentication process includes a second factor it may likewise prevent access to your application.</li>
                <li>If <risk-exposure is-exposed="false" />, the login attempts will eventually result in the account being locked out, or gradually increase the response time for each authentication attempt (thus discouraging brute forcing of the passwords).</li>
