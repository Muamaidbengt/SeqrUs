<div class="seq-description">
    <p>
        When your system is being attacked, you want to:
        <ul>
            <li>cecome alerted to the attack so you can activate countermeasures to foil the attacker</li>
            <li>determine the source, target, scope and effects of the attack</li>
            <li>monitor the attack patterns to adapt for future attacks</li>
            <li>collect evidence of the attack to be used for prosecution of the attacker.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Exposure to this risk means that an attacker can go undetected in your application and that attacks can be made without fear of prosecution.</p>

        <p>Most successful attacks start with vulnerability probing. Allowing such probes to continue can raise the likelihood of successful exploit to nearly 100%.</p>
