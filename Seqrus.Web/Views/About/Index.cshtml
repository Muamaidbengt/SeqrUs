<h1>About this app</h1>
<p>
    This is an intentionally insecure webapp, intended to be used in security training for developers and testers.
    It highlights some (not all) ways in which an ASP.NET Core application
    can exhibit security vulnerabilities from the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">OWASP top 10 list (2017)</a>.
</p>

<h2>How to use this app</h2>
<p>
    By <a asp-controller="Config" asp-action="Index">changing the configuration of this app</a> and <a asp-controller="Risk" asp-action="Index">running the test cases</a>, 
    you can see how security flaws/countermeasures manifest themselves, and you can conduct similar tests on your own applications and environments.
</p>

<p>
    By reading through <a href="https://github.com/muamaidbengt/seqrus">the source code</a> (in particular, the @nameof(ConfigurableCountermeasures) class), 
    you can see how various countermeasures can be configured or implemented in ASP.NET Core. Due to the flexibility of ASP.NET Core, there is probably an infinite number of ways
    to address a particular security issue though, and the solutions offered here are not ideal for every application. YMMV.
